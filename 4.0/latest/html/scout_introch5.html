<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >In addition to the Scout runtime framework presented in the previous chapter Eclipse Scout also includes
a comprehensive tooling, the Scout SDK. Thanks to this tooling, developing Scout applications is made
simpler, more productive and also more robust. Initially, a solid understanding of the Java language is
sufficient to start developing Scout applications and only a rough understanding of the underlying
Eclipse/OSGi/JEE technologies is required.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >    The Scout SDK consists of navigation support for the application model defined by the Scout
runtime and provides many intuitive component wizards. This creates an ideal environment for
beginners to build complete, high-quality Scout applications. Typically Java developers only
need a few days of Scout training to start creating their own advanced client server business
applications.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >    The Scout SDK also helps developers to become more productive. Many repetitive and error prone
tasks run automatically in the background or are taken care of by the component wizards of the Scout
SDK. This starts with the initial creation of a Scout client server application, continues with the wizards
to create complete dialogs and pages and includes the automatic management of the data transfer objects
needed for the client server communication.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >    Finally, the application code created by the Scout SDK wizards helps to ensure that the resulting
Scout application has a consistent and robust code base and is well aligned with the application model
defined by the Scout runtime framework.

perspective<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="scout_intro52.html#fn1x6"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x51-43002f1"></a> .
With the Scout Explorer and Scout Objects Properties, two view parts are contained in the Scout
perspective. Additionally, the Scout SDK contains a comprehensive set of wizards that support the
developer in creating Scout application components.
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >    The Scout Explorer view allows the developer to navigate the Scout application model. Once an
element in the Scout Explorer is selected, the Scout Object properties view allows to validate and change
properties of the selected element. Depending on the selection in the Scout Explorer, the Scout SDK
offers appropriate context menus to start the related wizards.

<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >    Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x51-430031">4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_sdk_perspective --></a> provides a screenshot of the Scout SDK perspective. In the Scout Explorer shown in the
upper left part of the screenshot, the message field in the DesktopForm of the &#8221;Hello World&#8221; application
is selected. In the Scout Object Properties located below, the message field&#8217;s appearance, layout and
behavior properties are displayed. On the right hand side, the corresponding source code is loaded in a
Java editor.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >    When the developer changes a property of the selected element, the Java code is updated accordingly
and vice versa. For example clicking the <span 
class="cmti-10">Mandatory </span>property in the Scout Object Properties of the
message field will insert the method <span 
class="cmtt-10">getConfiguredMandatory </span>to the message field&#8217;s class. This
demonstrates how the Scout SDK directly works on the Java source code. In fact, the Java source code is
almost the only artifact relevant for the Scout SDK to &#8217;understand&#8217; the Scout application model. Taking
advantage of this setup, the Scout SDK implements a full round-trip-engineering from creating the Java
code for Scout application components, parsing code changes in the background, and displaying the
current implementation of the Scout application in the Scout Explorer and the Scout Object
Properties.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >    Thanks to the round-trip-engineering provided by the Scout SDK, the information presented in the
Scout Explorer and the Scout Object Properties always stay in sync with the Java code of the Scout
application. To illustrate this, we will re-use the &#8221;Hello World&#8221; Scout project from Chapter&#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >    After having saved the code change, you can observe that the <span 
class="cmti-10">Mandatory </span>property in the
section Behavior of the message field&#8217;s Scout Object properties has changed its state. The font
of its label is now presented in bold face and underlined, the checkbox is ticked and a red
minus icon is shown on the right side of the property. Obviously, the Scout SDK is directly
operating on the project&#8217;s source code and does not rely or need any external meta data. This
provides the flexibility to develop Scout applications with or without the support of the Scout
SDK. And this choice offered to the Scout developer is one of the most important features
provided by the Scout SDK. The Scout developer may take advantage of the development
support provided by the Scout SDK without being restricted by the Scout tooling in any
way.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >    Technically, the Scout SDK is a set of Eclipse plugins that operate on top

<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >The Scout Explorer view is responsible for the navigation support within the Scout application model. This
navigation support is presented in the form of a tree view and includes the client with its UI components, the

<span

reminder of this section we will describe the procedure how to change or update the properties and
operations of Scout components. To indicate non-default property values or non-default behavior,
the font of the property or operation is switched to underlined bold face. As an example,
consider the property <span 
class="cmti-10">Ask If Need Save </span>of the desktop form shown on the left side of Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x51-450036">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:properties_view_examples --></a>.
The bold font visualizes that this does not correspond to the default behavior of forms. And
underlining of this property further indicates, that the label has become a clickable link.
Clicking on this label will load the corresponding method into the Java editor in the Scout
SDK.
<!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >    To change a property for a specific Scout component just enter a value in the corresponding field or
tick/untick the provided checkbox. In some cases the value may also be chosen from a dropdown list.
For the label field shown on the right hand side of Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x51-450036">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:properties_view_examples --></a>, the &#8221;Message&#8221; value refers
to the translation of the text key to be used in method <span 
class="cmtt-10">getConfiguredLabel</span>. To enter a
new label text, start typing the desired translated label and pick the option &#8221;New translated
text...&#8221;.
<!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >    To reset a property or operation to its default value/behavior, you may click on the red <span

class="small-caps">n</span><span 
class="small-caps">u</span><span

Java code.

<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >The Scout SDK wizards allow the developer to create Scout application model components with just a
few clicks. Creation wizards are provided for all major model components such as forms on the
client side or services on the server side. The usage of wizards not only makes developing
Scout applications efficient but also helps to create robust code and reduces the number of
errors.
<!--l. 262--><p class="indent" >    Scout SDK wizards can do many things. They add and update Java classes, register
services in the <span class="path"><span

class="cmtt-10">MANIFEST.MF</span></span> files and
update Eclipse product files when necessary. All these capabilities hide a lot of the complexity
of writing Eclipse based applications. This simplifies the development of Scout application
considerably.

the RAP UI plugin is necessary. For a desktop only client, either the Swing or the SWT UI plugin
