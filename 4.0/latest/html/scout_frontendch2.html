<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Scout is an open source framework for building business applications. The Scout framework covers most
recurring aspects of a classical client server architecture with a strong focus on the application&#8217;s
front-end. With its multi-device capability, a Scout client applications may run simultaneously as a rich
client, in the browser and on mobile and tablet devices.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >    To different groups of people, Scout means different things. End users are interested in a
good usability, the management cares about the benefits a new framework can offers to the
organisation and developers want to know if a framework is simple to use and helps them to solve
practical issues. This is why the text below describes Scout from the perspective of these three
roles.

    <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x4-50001.1.1"></a>End User Perspective</h4>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >End users of enterprise applications care about friendly user interfaces (UI) and well designed
functionality that support them in their everyday work. Depending on the current context/location of an
end user, either desktop, web or mobile clients work best. If working in the office, a good integration of
the enterprise software with Lotus Notes or Microsoft Office often help to boost the users productivity. As
office software is typically installed locally on the users PC, integrating this software also requires a
desktop client for the enterprise application. When a user is working on a computer outside of his
company where the enterprise client is not installed (or the user lacks the permissions to install
any software), the natural choice is to work with a web application. And when the user is
on the move or sitting in a meeting, the only meaningful option is to work with a mobile
device.

comparing the screenshots of the desktop client with the web application it is interesting to note how
Scout applications offer a consistent look and feel for the two clients. This is important as it makes the

href="#x4-50033">1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:bsi_crm_mobile --></a> provides a screenshot of the now familiar CRM application. In contrast to
desktop and web applications, most tablets and mobile phones are controlled using touch features instead
of mouse clicks. In addition, less elements may be presented on a single screen compared to desktop
devices. These two aspects makes it impractical to directly reuse the desktop user interface on mobile
devices. The look and feel still relates to the desktop and web clients but is optimized to the different
form factor of the mobile device. And the end user benefits from the identical behaviour and the the
known functionality of the application.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >    Comparing the company table shown in the background of Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x4-50011">1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:bsi_crm_desktop --></a> with Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x4-50033">1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:bsi_crm_mobile --></a> it can be
observed that the multi-column table of the desktop client has been transformed into a list on the mobile
device. In addition, the context menu &#8221;New company&#8221; is now provided as a touch button. As the
navigation in the application and the offered choices remain the same for Scout desktop and
mobile applications, the end user feels immediately comfortable working with Scout mobile
applications.

<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >For the management, Scout is best explained in terms of benefits it brings to the organisation in question.
This is why we are going to concentrate on a (typical) application migration scenario here. Let us assume
that to support the company&#8217;s business, a fairly large landscape of multi-tier applications has to be
maintained and developed. Including host systems, client server applications with desktop clients, as well
as applications with a web based front-end.

href="#x4-60014">1.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_with_other_apps --></a>.
Often, some of the applications that are vital to the organisation&#8217;s core business have grown historically
and are based on legacy technologies. And for technologies that are no longer under active development it
can get difficult to find staff having the necessary expertise or motivation. Sometimes, the
organisation is no longer willing to accept the costs and technology risks of such mission critical
applications.

<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >    In this situation, the company needs to evaluate if it should buy a new standard product or if the old
application has to be migrated to a new technology stack. Now let us assume, that available products do
not fit the company&#8217;s requirements well enough and we have to settle for the migration scenario.
In the target architecture, a clean layering similar to the one shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x4-60025">1.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_integration --></a> is often
desirable.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >    While a number of modern and established technologies exist that address the backend side (data
bases, data access and business services), the situation is different for the UI layer and the
application layer. The number of frameworks to develop web applications with Java is excessively
large<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="scout_frontend5.html#fn1x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x4-6003f1"></a> ,
but the choice between desktop application technologies in the Java domain is restricted to three options
only. Swing, SWT and JavaFX. Both Eclipse SWT and Java Swing are mature and well established but
Swing is moving into &#8217;maintenance only&#8217; mode and will be replaced by JavaFX. However, the maturity of
the new JavaFX technology in large complex enterprise applications is not yet established. Obviously,
deciding for the right UI technology is a challenge and needs to be made very carefully. Reverting this
decision late in a project or after going into production can get very expensive and time
consuming.
<!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >    Once the organisation has decided for a specific UI technology, additional components and
frameworks need to be evaluated to cover client server communication, requirements for the application
layer, and integration into the existing application landscape. To avoid drowning in the integration effort
for all the elements necessary to cover the UI and the application layer a &#8217;lightweight&#8217; framework is
frequently developed. When available, this framework initially leads to desirable gains in productivity.
Unfortunately, such frameworks often become legacy by themselves. Setting up a dedicated team to
actively maintain the framework and adapt to new technologies can reduce this risk. But then again, such
a strategy is expensive and developing business application frameworks is usually not the core business of
a company.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >    Can we do better? To implement a business application that covers the UI and the application layer
as shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x4-60025">1.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_integration --></a>, Eclipse Scout substantially reduces both risk and costs compared to the inhouse
development presented above. First or all, Scout is completely based on Java and Eclipse. Chances are,
that developers are already familiar with some of these technologies. This helps in getting developers up
to speed and keeping training costs low.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >    On the UI side, Scout&#8217;s multi-device support almost allows to skip the decision for a specific UI
technology. Should a particular web framework become the de-facto standard in the next years, it
will be the responsibility of the Scout framework to provide the necessary support. Existing
Scout applications can then switch to this new technology with only minimal effort. This is
possible because the Scout developers are designing and building the UI of an application using
Scout&#8217;s client model. And this client model is not linked to any specific UI technology. Rather,
specific UI renderers provided by the Scout framework are responsible to draw the UI at
runtime.
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >    As Scout is an open source project, no licence fees are collected. Taking advantage of the growing
popularity of Scout, free community support is available via a dedicated forum. At the same time,
professional support is available if the organisation decides for it.
                                                                                 

                                                                                 
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >    As the migration of aging applications to current technology is always a challenge, it surely helps to
have Scout in the technology portfolio. Not only is it a low risk choice, but also boosts developer
productivity and helps to motivate the development team. Additional reasons on why Scout helps to drive
down cost and risks are discussed in Section&#x00A0;<a

    <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x4-70001.1.3"></a>Developer Perspective</h4>
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >From the perspective of application developers, Scout offers a Java based framework that covers the
complete client server architecture. This implies that &#8211; once familiar with the Scout framework &#8211; the
developer can concentrate on a single framework language (Java) and a single set of development
tools.
<!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >    As Scout is completely based on Java and Eclipse, Scout developers can take full advantage of
existing knowledge and experience in these domains. And to make learning Scout as simple as possible,
Scout includes a comprehensive software development kit (SDK), the Scout SDK. The Scout SDK helps
to create a robust initial project setup for client server applications and includes a large set of wizards for
repetitive and error prone tasks.
<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >    On the client-side Scout&#8217;s flexible client model allows the developer to create a good user experience
without having to care about specific UI technologies. The reason for this can be found in Scout&#8217;s
client architecture that cleanly separates the UI model from the UI technology. In Scout
(almost) every UI component is implemented four times. First the implementation of the UI
model component and then, three rendering components for each UI technology supported by
Scout. For desktop clients these are the Swing and the SWT technologies, and for the web
and mobile support this is Eclipse RAP which in turn takes care of the necessary JavaScript
parts.
<!--l. 165--><p class="indent" >    Not having to worry about Swing, SWT or JavaScript can significantly boost the productivity. With
one exception. If a specific UI widget is missing for the user story to be implemented, the Scout developer
first needs to implement such a widget. Initially, this task is slightly more complex than not
working with Scout. For custom widgets the Scout developer needs to implement both a model
component and a rendering component for a specific UI technology. But as soon as the client
application needs to be available on more than a single frontend, the investment already pays off.
The developer already did implement the model component and only needs to provide an
additional rendering component for the new UI technology. In most situations the large set of
Scouts UI components provided out-of-the box are sufficient and user friendly applications are
straight forward to implement. Even if the application needs to run on different target devices
simultaneously.
<!--l. 175--><p class="indent" >    Client-server communication is an additional aspect where the developers is supported by Scout.
Calling remote services in the client application that are provided by the Scout server looks identical to
the invocation of local services. The complete communication including the transfer of parameter objects
is handled fully transparent by the Scout framework. In addition, the Scout SDK can completely manage
the necessary transfer objects to fetch data from the Scout server that is to be shown in dialog forms
on the Scout client. The binding of the transferred data to the form fields is done by the
framework.
<!--l. 181--><p class="indent" >    Although the Scout SDK wizards can generate a significant amount of code, there
is no one-way code generation and no meta data in a Scout application. Just the Java
                                                                                 

                                                                                 
code<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="scout_frontend6.html#fn2x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x4-7001f2"></a> .
Developers preferring to write the necessary code manually, may do so. The Scout SDK parses the
application&#8217;s Java code in the background to present the updated Scout application model to the
developers preferring to work with the Scout SDK.
<!--l. 188--><p class="indent" >    Finally, Scout is an open source framework hosted at the Eclipse foundation. This provides a number
of interesting options to developers that are not available for closed source frameworks. First of all,
it is simple to get all the source code of Scout and the underlying Eclipse platform. This
allows for complete debugging of all problems and errors found in Scout applications. Starting
from the application code, including the Scout framework, Eclipse and down to the Java
platform.
<!--l. 194--><p class="indent" >    Scout developer can also profit from an increasing amount of free and publicly available
documentation, such as this book or the Scout Wiki pages. And problems with Scout or questions that
are not clearly addressed by existing documentation can be discussed in the Scout forum. The
forum is also a great place for Scout developers to help out in tricky situation and learn from
others. Ideally, answered questions lead to improved or additional documentation in the Scout
Wiki.
<!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >    At times, framework bugs can be identified from questions asked in the forum. As all other
enhancement requests and issues, such bugs can be reported in Bugzilla by the Scout developer. Using
Bugzilla, Scout developers can also contribute bug analysis and patch proposals to solve the reported
issue. With this process, Scout developers can actively contribute to the code base of Eclipse Scout. This
has the advantage, that workarounds in existing Scout applications can be removed when an upgrade of
the Scout framework is made.
<!--l. 205--><p class="indent" >    Having provided a significant number of high quality patches and a meaningful involvement in the Scout
community, the Scout project can nominate a Scout developer as a new Scout committer. Fundamentally,
such a nomination is based on the trust of Scout committers in the candidate. To quote the official
guidelines<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="scout_frontend7.html#fn3x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a

Scout developer effectively becomes a Scout committer. With this new status, the Scout developer then
gets write access to the Eclipse Scout repositories and gains voting rights and the possibility to shape the
future of Scout.
    <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x4-80001.2"></a>Why Scout?</h3>
<!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >Most large organizations develop and maintain enterprise applications that have a direct impact on the
success of the ongoing business. And at the same time, those responsible for the development and
maintenance of these applications struggle with this task. It is a big challenge to adapt to
changing business demands and complying with the latest legal requirements in time. And the
increasing pressure to lower recurring maintenance costs does not make the situation any
easier.
<!--l. 234--><p class="indent" >    It often seems that too many resources are required to keep a heterogeneous set of legacy
technologies alive. In this situation, modernizing mission critical applications can help to improve over the
current situation. For the target platform stack, Java is a natural choice as it is mature, widely adopted
by in the industries and unlikely to become legacy in the foreseeable future. While for the back-end side
of enterprise applications well-known and proven frameworks do exist, the situation on the client
side is less clear. Unfortunately, user interface (UI) technologies often have lifetimes that are
substantially shorter than the lifetimes of larger mission critical applications. This is particularly true
for the web, where many of today&#8217;s frameworks will no longer be relevant in five or more
years.
<!--l. 241--><p class="indent" >    Enter Eclipse Scout. This open source framework covers most of the recurring needs that are relevant
to the front-end development of business applications. And Scout forces a clean separation between the
user interface and the specific UI technology used for rendering. This has two major benefits. First, Scout
developers implement the user interface against an abstraction layer, which helps to focus on the business
functionality and saves development time. And second, long term maintenance costs are lower, as the
Scout code remains valid even when the rendering technology needs to be exchanged. Therefore, Scout
helps to improve the productivity of the development teams and reduces the risk of major application
rewrites.
<!--l. 248--><p class="indent" >    To provide a first impression on the scope and goals of the Scout framework, a number of scenarios
where Scout typically contributes to your projects success are listed below .
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">You are looking for a reasonable client side framework for your business application.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">You need an application that works on the desktop, in browsers and on mobiles devices.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">You don&#8217;t have the time to evaluate and learn a new UI technology.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">You need a working prototype application by the end of the week.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Your application&#8217;s expected lifespan is 10 years or more.</li></ul>
                                                                                 

                                                                                 
<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >That Scout should help in the last two situations mentioned above seems to be contradictory at first but
is just based on a simple principle. Where possible, the Scout framework provides abstractions for
areas/topics<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="scout_frontend8.html#fn4x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x4-8001f4"></a> 
that need to be implemented for business applications again and again. And for each of these
abstractions Scout provides a default implementation out of the box. Typically, the default
implementation of such an abstraction integrates a framework or technology that is commonly
used.
<!--l. 266--><p class="indent" >    When needing a working prototype application by the end of the week, the developer just
needs to care about the desired functionality. The necessary default implementations are then
automatically included by the Scout tooling into the Scout project setup. The provided Scout SDK
tooling also helps to get started quickly with Scout. It also allows to efficiently implement
application components such as user interface components, server services or connections to
databases.
<!--l. 271--><p class="indent" >    In the case of applications with long lifespans, the abstractions provided by Scout help the developer
to stay productive and concentrate on the actual business functionality. At the same time, this keeps the
code base as independent of specific technologies and frameworks as possible. This is a big advantage
when individual technologies incorporated in the application reach their end of life. As all the
implemented business functionality is written against abstractions only, no big rewrite of the application
is necessary. Instead, it is sufficient to exchange the implementation for the legacy technology with a new
one. And often, an implementation for a new technology/framework is already provided by a more recent
version of Scout.
